# web_dev_portfolio
This is the repository I will use to build my web development portfolio. It includes a blurb about me, the attachments to my work, and ways to contact me. Currently, the published page include placeholder texts and images, but will be updated as I progress through my web development journey. As of now, under my work section, you can view my travel blog by clicking on the 'travel blog' image, a coding quiz webpage by clicking on the 'coding quiz' image, a password generator by clicking on the 'password generator' image, and a Kanban task board by clicking on the 'task board' image.
