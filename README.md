# web_dev_portfolio
This is the repository I will use to build my web development portfolio. It includes a blurb about me, the attachments to my work, and ways to contact me. My webpage includes a navigation bar at the very top, with interactive buttons: 'About Me', 'Work', and 'Contact Me', that will automatically scroll to the location on the webpage. To view my work, you can click on thhe image tiles under my 'Work' section, and you will be redirceted to a new tab with the project. I currently have 4 projects: a travel blog, coding quiz, password generator, and a Kanban task board. I will continue to update my portfolio as I complete more projects. If you'd like to contact me, please find my contact details under the 'Contact Me' section, or fill the webform and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.
